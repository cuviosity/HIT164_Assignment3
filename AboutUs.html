        At Crackerbarell, we believe that great tasting goods start with simple, honest ingredients and a barrel full of love. 
        What began as a passion for warm, freshly baked bread and sweets has grown into a cozy neighborhood bakery  â€” no shortcuts, just time-honored techniques and real, barrell-ful ingredients.

Every croissant we fold, every loaf we shape, and every cupcake we frost is a reflection of our dedication to quality and our love for the community we serve. 

Stop by, say hello, and let us share something barrell-icious with you.

            Where It All Started...
        </h1>
        Cracker Bakery started in 1952 when grandpa Ernie returned from war with just twenty-seven dollars and his grandmother's recipe book. He began by selling buttermilk bicuits door-to-door in a box, and within six months had earned enough to rent out an old storefront.
         The shop kept the wooden barrels from the previous general store, which stored crackers and flour. When people asked where the name originated from, he would say "We kept the barrels, and everything here cracks open the right way"
